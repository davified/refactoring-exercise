## Introduction

Clean code practices (from [Clean Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882) and [Refactoring](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Existing-Addison-Wesley-Signature/dp/0134757599)) adapted for machine learning / data science workflows in Python. This is not a style guide. It's a guide to producing
readable, reusable, and refactorable software.

If you’ve tried your hand at machine learning or data science, you would know that code can get messy, quickly.

Unclean code adds to complexity by making code difficult to read and modify. As a consequence, changing code to respond to business needs becomes increasingly difficult, and sometimes even impossible. This has been written about extensively in several languages, and even in Python (e.g. Clean Code, Refactoring, clean-code-python). In this repo, we have adapted these principles for data science / machine learning codebases.

## The 5 S's of Clean Code

By James O Coplien (Source: Foreword of Clean Code (Robert C. Martin))

In about 1951, a quality approach called Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) came on the Japanese scene. Its focus is on maintenance rather than on production. One of the major pillars of TPM is the set of so-called 5S principles:
- **Seiri**, or organization (think **sort** in English). Knowing where things are—using approaches such as suitable naming—is crucial.
- **Seiton**, or tidiness (think **systematize** in English). There is an old American saying: A place for everything, and everything in its place. A piece of code should be where you expect to find it—and, if not, you should re-factor to get it there.
- **Seiso**, or cleaning (think **shine** in English): Keep the workplace free of hanging wires, grease, scraps, and waste. What do the authors here say about littering your code with comments and commented-out code lines that capture history or wishes for the future? Get rid of them.
- **Seiketsu**, or **standardization**: The group agrees about how to keep the workplace clean. Have a consistent coding style and set of practices within the group.
- **Shutsuke**, or discipline (**self-discipline**). This means having the discipline to follow the practices and to frequently reflect on one’s work and be willing to change.

## Hands-on Exercise

If you'd like to try out these practices, we've created a [refactoring exercise](./docs/refactoring-exercise.md) which you can follow along. Starting with [a jupyter notebook with many code smells](notebooks/titanic-notebook-1.ipynb), you can apply these clean code principles and refactor it to be readable and maintainable. The sample final solution can be found in [`src/train.py`](src/train.py).
